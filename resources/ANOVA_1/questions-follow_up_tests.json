  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Why are follow-up tests such as planned comparisons or post-hoc tests necessary after a significant one-way ANOVA?",
      "options": [
        "To check if the assumption of homogeneity of variance has been met.",
        "To calculate the effect size (partial eta-squared) for the overall model.",
        "Because the ANOVA is an omnibus test and does not specify which particular group means are different from each other.",
        "They are only necessary if the ANOVA result is not significant, to see if any smaller differences exist."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A significant ANOVA F-ratio is an 'omnibus' result, indicating that a difference exists somewhere among the groups, but it doesn't identify the specific pairs of groups that differ. Follow-up tests are required for this."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Under which circumstance should a researcher use planned comparisons instead of post-hoc tests?",
      "options": [
        "When the researcher has no specific hypotheses and wants to explore all possible group differences.",
        "When the initial ANOVA F-test is not significant.",
        "When the researcher has specific, theory-driven hypotheses about which groups should differ before the experiment is run.",
        "When the data violates the assumption of normality."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Planned comparisons (contrasts) are used to test a small number of specific hypotheses that were formulated *before* data collection, based on theory or prior research."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Which type of follow-up test is generally considered more statistically powerful?",
      "options": [
        "Post-hoc tests",
        "Planned comparisons",
        "Levene's test",
        "They both have equal statistical power."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Planned comparisons are more powerful because they focus the statistical test on a specific hypothesis, whereas post-hoc tests spread the statistical power across all possible comparisons, making them more conservative."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Post-hoc tests like the Bonferroni correction are designed to control for what specific problem?",
      "options": [
        "A decrease in statistical power.",
        "The inflation of the familywise error rate (increased risk of a Type I error).",
        "Violations of the assumption of sphericity.",
        "Forgetting to counterbalance the experimental conditions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Conducting multiple comparisons increases the probability of making at least one Type I error (a false positive). Post-hoc corrections adjust the p-value for each comparison to keep the overall (familywise) error rate at a specified level (e.g., .05)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "What is the most important rule to follow before conducting any follow-up tests?",
      "options": [
        "The groups must have equal sample sizes.",
        "The initial F-ratio from the omnibus ANOVA must be statistically significant.",
        "The data must be perfectly normally distributed.",
        "You must have at least five groups to compare."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Follow-up tests are only justified if the overall ANOVA indicates that there is a significant difference to be found among the groups. If the F-ratio is not significant, any differences found in follow-up tests are likely due to chance."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "When setting up weights for a planned contrast, which of the following rules must be followed?",
      "options": [
        "The sum of the weights must equal 1.",
        "All weights must be positive.",
        "The sum of the weights for a given contrast must equal 0.",
        "Every group must be assigned a non-zero weight."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A fundamental rule of contrasts is that the weights (coefficients) assigned to the groups for any single contrast must sum to zero. This ensures a meaningful comparison is being made."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "In a planned contrast, if a group is assigned a weight of 0, what does this signify?",
      "options": [
        "This group is the primary group being tested.",
        "This group's mean is expected to be zero.",
        "A calculation error has been made.",
        "This group is not included in this specific comparison."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Assigning a weight of 0 effectively removes that group from the specific hypothesis being tested by that contrast. Groups with positive weights are compared against groups with negative weights."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",

        "The omnibus F-test",
        "Levene's test"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Post-hoc tests are designed for exploratory analysis where the researcher wants to compare every group with every other group to discover where significant differences might exist."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "A researcher compares a control group, a group receiving Therapy A, and a group receiving Therapy B. A contrast is set up with weights: Control = -2, Therapy A = +1, Therapy B = +1. What hypothesis is this contrast testing?",
      "options": [
        "Is Therapy A more effective than Therapy B?",
        "Is the control group different from Therapy A?",
        "Is there any difference between the three groups?",
        "Are the two therapy groups, on average, different from the control group?"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This contrast pools the two therapy groups (both have positive weights) and compares their combined mean against the control group (which has a negative weight)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Why is it generally considered better practice to use planned comparisons over post-hoc tests if you have strong a priori hypotheses?",
      "options": [
        "Because planned comparisons are easier to calculate by hand.",
        "Because they are more powerful and directly test your theory, which is a more rigorous scientific approach.",
        "Because post-hoc tests can only be used with large sample sizes.",
        "Because JASP and SPSS cannot perform post-hoc tests correctly."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Using planned comparisons demonstrates that you had a clear theoretical reason for your experiment. They are also more statistically powerful, making it more likely you'll find a true effect if one exists."
