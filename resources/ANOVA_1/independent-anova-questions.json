      "options": [
        "To compare the means of two independent groups on a single dependent variable.",
        "To compare the means of the same group at three or more different time points.",

      "question": "What is the primary statistical problem with conducting multiple t-tests instead of an ANOVA when comparing three or more groups?",
      "options": [
        "It decreases the statistical power of the study.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Multiple t-tests inflate the familywise error rate due to multiple comparisons, which is why ANOVA is preferred."
