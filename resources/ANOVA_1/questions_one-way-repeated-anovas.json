  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "When is it most appropriate to use a One-Way Repeated-Measures ANOVA?",
      "options": [
        "To compare the means of two independent groups.",
        "To compare the means of three or more independent groups.",
        "To compare the means of the same group under three or more different conditions or time points.",
        "To assess the relationship between two continuous variables for the same group."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA is used when you have one independent variable with three or more levels, and the same participants are tested in all conditions (a within-subjects design)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of a repeated-measures design over a between-subjects design?",
      "options": [
        "It is immune to practice effects.",
        "It requires more participants to achieve the same level of statistical power.",
        "It is statistically more powerful because it removes variance caused by individual differences from the error term.",
        "It does not require any assumptions about the data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Repeated-measures designs are more powerful because they account for the 'noise' from individual differences, leading to a smaller error term and a larger F-ratio."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "In a repeated-measures ANOVA, the denominator of the F-ratio is the:",
      "options": [
        "Mean Square Between-Conditions (MS_conditions)",
        "Mean Square Within-Subjects (MS_within)",
        "Mean Square Residual (MS_residual)",
        "Mean Square Subjects (MS_subjects)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The F-ratio for a repeated-measures ANOVA is calculated as F = MS_conditions / MS_residual. The MS_residual represents the unsystematic variance after individual differences have been removed."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Which statement best describes the error term (denominator) in a repeated-measures ANOVA?",
      "options": [
        "It is the same as the error term in an independent ANOVA.",
        "It represents the variance due to the experimental manipulation.",
        "It is the within-conditions variance after the variance due to individual differences has been factored out.",
        "It is simply the variance attributable to individual differences between participants."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The key feature of a repeated-measures ANOVA is that it partitions out the variance from individual differences, resulting in a smaller, more sensitive error term (SS_residual = SS_within - SS_subjects)."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "What is the key assumption that is unique to repeated-measures ANOVA with three or more levels?",

        "Homogeneity of variance",
        "Normality",
        "Independence of observations",
        "Sphericity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Sphericity is a specific assumption for repeated-measures ANOVA, stating that the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of conditions are equal."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Which statistical test is used to check the assumption of sphericity?",
      "options": [
        "Levene's Test",
        "The F-test",
        "Mauchly's Test of Sphericity",
        "Tukey's HSD Test"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Mauchly's test is specifically designed to assess whether the assumption of sphericity has been met."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "A researcher obtains a p-value of .021 from Mauchly's Test. What is the correct interpretation and action?",
      "options": [
        "Sphericity is assumed (p > .05), and the standard ANOVA results can be reported.",
        "Sphericity is violated (p < .05), and a correction should be reported.",
        "The main ANOVA effect is significant, and post-hoc tests are needed.",
        "The main ANOVA effect is not significant."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "A significant Mauchly's test (p < .05) indicates that the assumption of sphericity has been violated. Therefore, corrected F-test results must be reported."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "If the assumption of sphericity is violated, what is the effect on the F-ratio?",
      "options": [
        "It leads to an increased risk of a Type II error (false negative).",
        "It leads to an increased risk of a Type I error (false positive).",
        "It has no effect on the F-ratio or the error rate.",
        "It makes the F-ratio smaller."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Violating sphericity inflates the F-ratio, increasing the likelihood of a Type I error. Corrections like Greenhouse-Geisser adjust the degrees of freedom to produce a more accurate p-value."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "In the formula SS_residual = SS_within - SS_subjects, what does SS_subjects represent?",
      "options": [
        "The experimental effect.",
        "Random error unrelated to participants.",
        "The variance attributable to consistent individual differences across conditions.",
        "The total variance in the entire dataset."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "SS_subjects quantifies the variability between participants' overall mean scores, representing the 'noise' from individual differences that can be removed."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Everything else being equal, a repeated-measures design is considered more 'powerful' than a between-subjects design primarily because:",
      "options": [
        "The numerator of the F-ratio (MS_conditions) is larger.",
        "The denominator of the F-ratio (MS_residual) is smaller.",
        "It's easier to recruit participants.",
        "Practice effects always help find a significant result."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Power is increased because by removing individual difference variance, the denominator (error term) becomes smaller, which leads to a larger F-ratio for the same effect size."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "How should data be structured in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel, CSV) for a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA in JASP?",
      "options": [
        "Long format: one column for participant ID, one for the condition, and one for the score.",
        "Wide format: each participant has one row, and each condition has its own column containing the scores.",
        "Each condition's data should be in a separate file.",
        "One column for all scores, with group labels in the adjacent column."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Repeated-measures designs in JASP require a 'wide' data format, where each row represents a single participant and their scores for each condition are in separate columns."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "What is the null hypothesis (H₀) for a repeated-measures ANOVA comparing a new therapy's effectiveness at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months?",
      "options": [
        "μ_baseline ≠ μ_6months ≠ μ_12months",
        "μ_baseline < μ_6months < μ_12months",
        "At least one time point will have a different mean score from the others.",
        "μ_baseline = μ_6months = μ_12months"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The null hypothesis for any ANOVA states that there is no difference between the means of the conditions being compared."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "The effect size measure partial eta-squared (η²p) in a repeated-measures ANOVA is calculated as:",
      "options": [
        "SS_conditions / SS_total",
        "SS_conditions / (SS_conditions + SS_residual)",
        "SS_subjects / SS_total",
        "SS_residual / (SS_conditions + SS_residual)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Partial eta-squared represents the proportion of variance explained by the within-subjects factor, after accounting for other factors. For a one-way design, it's η²p = SS_conditions / (SS_conditions + SS_residual)."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Why is there no need to check for sphericity when a repeated-measures IV has only two levels?",
      "options": [
        "Because it is impossible for the variances to be different.",
        "Because with only two levels, the test automatically uses a correction.",
        "Because there is only one set of difference scores, so the variance of the differences cannot be compared to anything.",
        "Because a t-test should always be used instead."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Sphericity is the assumption that the variances of the *differences between pairs of conditions* are equal. With only two conditions (A and B), there's only one difference (A-B), so the assumption is always met by default."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "An F-ratio that is less than 1.0 in a repeated-measures ANOVA suggests that:",
      "options": [
        "The treatment had a very strong effect.",
        "The amount of unexplained variance (MS_residual) is greater than the variance explained by the experimental conditions (MS_conditions).",
        "A calculation error must have occurred, as F cannot be less than 1.",
        "The result will be statistically significant."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "An F-ratio below 1 means the 'noise' (error) is greater than the 'signal' (effect), indicating the null hypothesis cannot be rejected."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "If a researcher finds a significant main effect in a repeated-measures ANOVA with four conditions, what is the most appropriate next step?",
      "options": [
        "Conclude that all four conditions are different from each other.",
        "Increase the sample size to confirm the finding.",
        "Conduct post-hoc tests (e.g., with Bonferroni correction) to see which specific conditions differ.",
        "Re-run the analysis as an independent ANOVA."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "A significant ANOVA is an omnibus test; it indicates a difference exists *somewhere* among the conditions. Post-hoc tests are required to perform pairwise comparisons and identify the specific differences."
    },

      "id": 18,
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "Which of the following does NOT apply to repeated measures designs?",
      "options": [
        "Individual differences are removed from the within-condition variance.",
        "Participants are tested in all conditions.",
        "They are generally more powerful than between-subjects designs.",
        "Variance due to individual differences contributes to the error term, adding noise."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "The entire point of a repeated measures ANOVA is to partition out and remove the variance due to individual differences from the error term, thereby *reducing* noise, not adding to it."

        "Within each experimental condition.",
        "Between the means of each experimental condition and the grand mean.",
        "That is left over after all other variance is accounted for."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "SS_conditions is the 'signal' or systematic variance. It quantifies how much the means of each condition deviate from the overall grand mean, reflecting the effect of the independent variable."

        "Make sure all participants have the same mean score."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Counterbalancing, where the order of conditions is varied across participants, is a crucial design feature to prevent order effects from confounding the results of a repeated-measures study."
