  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "topic": "Correlation",
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "A Pearson correlation is most appropriate for measuring the relationship between which types of variables?",
      "options": [
        "Two nominal variables.",
        "One continuous and one categorical variable.",
        "Two continuous variables.",
        "A ranked variable and a nominal variable."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pearson's correlation is designed to measure the linear relationship between two continuous variables (e.g., height and weight, or revision hours and exam score)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "topic": "Correlation",
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation of r = +0.75 between daily ice cream sales and the number of drowning incidents. This is a classic example of what principle?",
      "options": [
        "A strong causal relationship.",
        "Correlation does not equal causation, as a third variable (e.g., hot weather) likely influences both.",
        "A negative correlation.",
        "A calculation error, as these variables cannot be related."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "This is a textbook example of a spurious correlation. A third, confounding variable (the heat of the day) causes both an increase in ice cream sales and an increase in people swimming (and thus drowning incidents). The two variables are correlated, but one does not cause the other."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "topic": "Correlation",
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",
      "question": "To compare two variables measured on completely different scales (e.g., height in cm and annual income in £), correlation works by first:",
      "options": [
        "Removing all outliers from both datasets.",
        "Converting all scores for each variable into standardized Z-scores.",
        "Calculating the mean of each variable and correlating the means.",
        "Using only the top 50% of the data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Standardization is the key to correlation. By converting each score to a Z-score (how many standard deviations it is from its own mean), we put both variables onto a common, unit-less scale, allowing them to be compared and correlated."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "topic": "Correlation",
      "section": "Conceptual Understanding",

        "A perfect negative linear relationship.",
        "A perfect positive linear relationship.",
        "The absence of any linear relationship between the variables.",
        "That the two variables are identical."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "An r-value of 0 means there is no linear association. As one variable changes, there is no consistent, predictable linear change in the other. It does not rule out a non-linear relationship (e.g., a U-shape)."

        "0.70",

      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Pearson's r is the square root of R². The square root of 0.49 is 0.70. Since the question specifies the relationship is negative, the r value must be -0.70."

        "The data points form a perfect horizontal line."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "A strong correlation means the points are tightly clustered around an imaginary line. A positive correlation means this line slopes upwards (as X increases, Y increases)."

        "Caffeine intake causes an improvement in reaction time."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The correlation is negative (-0.45), meaning as one variable (caffeine) goes up, the other (reaction time) goes down. A lower reaction time is a faster reaction. The p-value of .005 indicates this is a statistically significant relationship."

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pearson's r only measures linear relationships. A scatterplot can reveal obvious non-linear patterns (like a U-shape), where r might be close to 0, misleadingly suggesting no relationship at all."
