      "question": "If the sum of the products of standardized scores is negative, what does this imply?",
      "options": [
        "A calculation error has been made.",
        "The correlation coefficient will be positive.",
        "The correlation coefficient will be negative.",
        "The correlation cannot be calculated."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The formula for r is (sum of (products of standardised scores of means) / (N-1). Since N-1 is always positive, the sign of the correlation coefficient is determined entirely by the sign of the sum of the products of the Z-scores."

        "25%",
        "It cannot be determined."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The R-squared value, when multiplied by 100, gives the percentage of shared variance. 0.25 * 100 = 25%."

      "question": "Using the equation 'Predicted Score = 29.574 + 0.480 * Revision Hours', what is the predicted score for someone who revised for 0 hours?",

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "When X=0, the equation becomes Predicted Score = 29.574 + (0.480 * 0), which equals 29.574. This demonstrates the definition of the intercept."
